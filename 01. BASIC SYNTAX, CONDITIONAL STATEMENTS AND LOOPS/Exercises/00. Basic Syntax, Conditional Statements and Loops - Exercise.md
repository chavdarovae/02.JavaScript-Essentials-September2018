## 1. Ages

Write a function that determines whether based on the given age a person is: baby, child, teenager, adult, elder. The input comes as **single number parameter**. The bounders are:

- **0-2 – baby;**
- **3-13 – child;**
- **14-19 – teenager;**
- **20-65 – adult;**
- **\&gt;=66 – elder;**
- All the values are **inclusive**.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 20 | adult |
| 1 | baby |
| 100 | elder |

## 2. Half cutter

You will get a size of a wooden piece that you have to cut in halves, until its size gets lower than one.

At the end you have to print its final size rounded to the second decimal point and how many cuts you have done in the format **&quot;Length is {length} cm after {number of cuts} cuts.&quot;**

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 1000 | Length is 0.98 cm. after 10 cuts. |
| 1 | Length is 0.50 cm. after 1 cuts. |


## 3. Division

You will be given a number and you have to return whether that number is divisible by the following numbers: 2, 3, 6, 7, and 10. You should **always take the bigger division**. If the number is divisible by both **2** and **3** it is also divisible by **6** and you should print only the division by 6. If a number is divisible by **2** it is sometimes also divisible by **10** and you should print the division by 10. If the number is not divisible by any of the given numbers print &quot; **Not divisible&quot;.** Otherwise print &quot; **The number is divisible by {number}**&quot;.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 30 | The number is divisible by 10 |
| 15 | The number is divisible by 3 |
| 12 | The number is divisible by 6 |
| 1643 | Not divisible |

## 4. Vacation

You are given a group of people, type of the group, on which day of the week they are going to stay. Based on that information calculate how much they have to pay and print that price on the console. Use the table below. In each cell is the price for a **single person**. The output should look like that: &quot; **Total price: {price}**&quot;. The price should be rounded to the second decimal point.

|
 | **Friday** | **Saturday** | **Sunday** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Students** | 8.45 | 9.80 | 10.46 |
| **Business** | 10.90 | 15.60 | 16 |
| **Regular** | 15 | 20 | 22.50 |

There are also discounts based on some conditions:

- **Students –** if the group is bigger than or equal to 30 people you should reduce the **total** price by 15%
- **Business –** if the group is bigger than or equal to 100 people **10** of them can stay **for free.**
- **Regular –** if the group is bigger than or equal 10 and less than or equal to 20 reduce the **total** price by 5%

**You should reduce the prices in that EXACT order**

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 30,&quot;Students&quot;,&quot;Sunday&quot; | Total price: 266.73 |
| 40,&quot;Regular&quot;,&quot;Saturday&quot; | Total price: 800.00 |

## 8. Login

You will be given a string representing a username. The password will be that username reversed. Until you receive the correct password print on the console &quot; **Incorrect password. Try again.**&quot;. When you receive the correct password print &quot; **User {username} logged in.**&quot; However on the fourth try if the password is still not correct print &quot; **User {username} blocked!**&quot; and end the program. The input comes as an **array of strings**.

## 9. \* The Pyramid of King Djoser

Write a JS program that calculates how much resources will be required for the construction of a pyramid. It is made out of **stone** , **marble** , **lapis lazuli** and **gold**. Your program will receive an integer that will be the **base** width and length of the pyramid and an **increment** , that is the height of each step. The bulk is made out of stone, while the **outer layer** is made out of marble. **Every fifth step&#39;s** outer layer is made out of lapis lazuli **instead** of marble. The **final step** is made out of gold.

The pyramid is built with **1x1 blocks** with **height** equal to the given **increment**. The first step of the pyramid has **width** and **length** equal to the given **base** and every next step is **reduced by 2 blocks** (1 from each side). The height of every step equals the given **increment**. See the drawing for an example. White steps are covered in marble, blue steps are covered in lapis lazuli ( **every fifth layer from the bottom** ), and yellow steps are made **entirely** out of gold ( **top-most step** ).

![](RackMultipart20200821-4-ojegda_html_68ca9354fe92dd07.png)

Since the **outer layer** of each step is made of a decorative material, to calculate the required stone for one step, reduce the width and length by 2 blocks (one from each side), find it&#39;s area and multiply it by the increment. The rest of the step is made out of lapis lazuli for every fifth step from the bottom and marble for all other steps. To find the amount needed, you may, for example, find its perimeter and reduce it by 4 (to compensate for the overlapping corners) and multiply the result by the increment. See the drawing for details (grey is stone, white is decoration).

Note the top-most layer is made entirely out of gold, with height equal to the given increment. See the examples for complete calculations.

### Input

You will receive two **number** parameters **base** and **increment**.

### Output

Print on the **console** on separate lines the **total** required **amounts** of each material **rounded up** and the **final height** of the pyramid **rounded down** , as shown in the examples.

### Constraints

- The **base** will always be an integer greater than zero
- The **increment** will always be a number greater than zero
- **Number.MAX\_SAFE\_INTEGER** will **never be exceeded** for any of the calculations

## 10. \* Bitcoin &quot;Mining&quot;

Write a JavaScript program that calculates the **total amount** of **bitcoins** you purchased with the gold you mined during your **shift** at the mine. Your shift consists of a certain number of days where you mine an amount of **gold** in **grams**. Your program will receive an **array with the amount of gold** you mined **each day** , where the **first day** of your **shift** is the **first index of the array**. Also, someone was stealing **every third day** from the start of your shift **30%** from the mined **gold** for **this day**. For the different exchanges use these **prices** :

| **1 Bitcoin** | 11949.16 lv. |
| --- | --- |
| **1 g of gold** | 67.51 lv. |

### Input

You will receive an array of **numbers** , representing your **shift** at the mine.

### Output

Print on the **console these lines in the following formats** :

- **First line** prints the **total**** amount **of bought** bitcoins**:

&quot; **Bought bitcoins: {count}**&quot;

- **Second line** prints **which day** you **bought** your **first bitcoin** :

&quot; **Day of the first purchased bitcoin: {day}**&quot;

In case you **did not**** purchased any bitcoins,** do not print the second line.

- **Third line** prints the **amount** of **money** that&#39;s left after the bitcoin purchases **rounded by the second digit** after the decimal point:

&quot; **Left money: {money} lv.**&quot;

### Constraints

- The **input** array may contain up to **1,000** elements
- The numbers in the array are in range **[0.01..5,000.00] inclusive**
- Allowed time/memory: 100ms/16MB

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
