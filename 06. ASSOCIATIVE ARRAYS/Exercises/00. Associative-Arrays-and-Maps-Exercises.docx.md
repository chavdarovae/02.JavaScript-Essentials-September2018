## 1. Words Tracker

Write a function that receives an **array of words** and finds **occurrences of given words** in that sentence. The input will come as **array of strings**. The **first string** will contain the **words** you will be looking for separated by a **space**. All **strings after that** will be the words you will be looking for. Print for **each word** how many times it **occurs**. The words should be **sorted by count in descending**.

### Example

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| [&#39;thissentence&#39;, &#39;In&#39;,&#39;this&#39;,&#39;sentence&#39;,&#39;you&#39;,&#39;have&#39;,&#39;to&#39;,&#39;count&#39;,&#39;the&#39;,&#39;occurances&#39;,&#39;of&#39;,&#39;the&#39;
 ,&#39;words&#39;,&#39;this&#39;,&#39;and&#39;,&#39;sentence&#39;,&#39;because&#39;,&#39;this&#39;,&#39;is&#39;,&#39;your&#39;,&#39;task&#39;] | this - 3
 sentence - 2 |

## 2. Odd Occurrences

Write a function that extracts all the elements of a sentence odd number of times. ( **case-insensitive** ). The input comes as a **single string**. The words will be **separated by a single space**.

### Example

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| &#39;Java C# Php PHP Java PhP 3 C# 3 1 5 C#&#39; | c# php 1 5 |

## 3. Piccolo

Write function that:

- Records a **car number** for every car that enters the **parking lot**
- Removes a **car number** when the car goes out
- Input will be array of strings in format **[direction, carNumber]**

Print the output with all car numbers which are in the parking lot **sorted in ascending by number**

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| [&#39;IN, CA2844AA&#39;,&#39;IN, CA1234TA&#39;,&#39;OUT, CA2844AA&#39;,&#39;IN, CA9999TT&#39;,&#39;IN, CA2866HI&#39;,&#39;OUT, CA1234TA&#39;,&#39;IN, CA2844AA&#39;,&#39;OUT, CA2866HI&#39;,&#39;IN, CA9876HH&#39;,&#39;IN, CA2822UU&#39;] | CA2822UUCA2844AACA9876HHCA9999TT |
| [&#39;IN, CA2844AA&#39;,&#39;IN, CA1234TA&#39;,&#39;OUT, CA2844AA&#39;,&#39;OUT, CA1234TA&#39;] | Parking Lot is Empty |

## 4. Party Time

There is a party at SoftUni. Many guests are invited and they are **two types** : VIP and regular. When guests come to the party check if he/she **exists** in any of the **two reservation lists**.

The input will come as **array of strings**. You will be given the list with the guests before you receive a command **&quot;PARTY&quot;**

All reservation **numbers will be with 8 chars**

All **VIP numbers start with digit**

When you receive the command **&quot;PARTY&quot;** the guests start coming.

Output all guest, who didn&#39;t come to the party (VIP must be first)

## 5. Card Game

You are given a sequence of people and for every person what cards he draws from the deck. The input will be **array of strings**. Each string will be in format:

**{personName}: {PT, PT, PT,â€¦ PT}**

Where P (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A) is the power of the card and T (S, H, D, C) is the type. The name can contain any ASCII symbol except **&#39;:&#39;**. The input will always be valid and in the format described, there is no need to check it.

A single person cannot have more than one card with the same power and type, if he draws such a card he discards it. The people are playing with multiple decks. Each card has a value that is calculated by the power multiplied by the type. Powers **2 to 10** have the same value and **J to A** are **11 to 14**. Types are mapped to multipliers the following way ( **S -\&gt; 4, H-\&gt; 3, D -\&gt; 2, C -\&gt; 1** ).

Finally print out the total value each player has in his hand in the format:

**{personName}: {value}**
