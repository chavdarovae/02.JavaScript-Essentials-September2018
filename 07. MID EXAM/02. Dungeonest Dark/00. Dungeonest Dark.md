# Problem 2. Dungeonest Dark

_As a young adventurer, you seek gold and glory in the darkest dungeons there are._

You have **initial health 100 and initial coins 0**. You will be given **a string, representing the dungeons rooms**. Each room is separated with **&#39;|&#39;** (vertical bar): **&quot;room1|room2|room3…&quot;**

Each room contains item or a monster and a number, separated by space. ( **&quot;item/monster number&quot;** )

- If the first part is **&quot;potion&quot;:** you are healed with the number in the second part. But your health **cannot exceed** your **initial health (100)**. Print: **&quot;You healed for {0} hp.&quot;**.

After that, print your current health: **&quot;Current health: {0} hp.&quot;**.

- If the first part is **&quot;chest&quot;** : You&#39;ve found some coins, the number in the second part. Print: **&quot;You found {0} coins.&quot;**.
- In any other case you are facing a monster, you are going to fight. The second part of the room, contains the attack of the monster. You should remove the monster&#39;s attack from your health.
  - If you are not dead (health \&lt;= 0) you&#39;ve slain the monster, and you should print ( **&quot;You slayed {monster}.&quot;** )
  - If you&#39;ve died, print **&quot;You died! Killed by {monster}.&quot;** and your quest is over. Print the best room you`ve manage to reach: **&quot;Best room: {room}&quot;**.

If you managed to go trough all the rooms in the dungeon, print on the next three lines:

**&quot;You&#39;ve made it!&quot;** , **&quot;Coins: {coins}&quot;** , **&quot;Health: {health}&quot;**.
