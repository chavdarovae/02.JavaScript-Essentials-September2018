# Problem 2. Deciphering

_Now that Gencho has filled his dictionary, he starts deciphering the old books to find in which one the relics and their locations are documented._

You will receive **two lines**. The first one will have an **encrypted string** , which you will have to decode. On the second line you will receive **two letters or substrings** , separated by **a single space**.
 First you will have to decode the first line by **reducing** the ASCII value of each character in it **by 3**. Then you should get the **two substrings** of the second line. You must find **every** occurrence of the **first substring** in the now decrypted text and replace it with the **second substring**.

Also, you don&#39;t know which book you have taken, so you must check if it is **valid**. A valid text contains only lowercase letters, from **&#39;d&#39;** onwards, and the symbols **&#39;{&#39;** , **&#39;}&#39;** , **&#39;|&#39;** , **&#39;#&#39;**. If the text is invalid, you should not try to decipher it and you should print **&quot;This is not the book you are looking for.&quot;**.

## Input

Two lines, one with text to decipher and one with two substrings to replace in the text.

## Output

One line with the deciphered text.
