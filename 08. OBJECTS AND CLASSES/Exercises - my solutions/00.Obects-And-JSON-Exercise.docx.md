# Classes

## 1. Class Vehicle

Create a class with name **Vehicle** that has the following properties:

**type** – a string

**model** – a string

**parts** – an object that contains:

engine – number (quality of the engine)

power – number

quality – engine \* power

**fuel** – a number

**drive** – a function that receives fuel loss and decreases the fuel of the vehicle by that number

The **constructor** should receive the **type** , the **model** , the **parts as an object** and the **fuel**

In judge post your **class** ( **Note: all names should be as described** )

### Example

Test your Vehicle class

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| let parts = {engine: 6, power: 100}let vehicle = new Vehicle(&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, parts, 200)vehicle.drive(100)console.log(vehicle.fuel)console.log(vehicle.parts.quality) | 100600 |

## 2. Class Storage

Create a class **named Storage**. It should have the following **properties** :

**capacity** – a number that **decreases when adding a given quantity** of products in storage

**storage** – **list of products** (object). **Each product** should have:

**name** - a string

**price** – a number (price is for a single piece of product)

**quantity** – a number

**totalCost** – sum of the cost of the products

**addProduct** – a function that receives a product and adds it to the storage

**getProcuts** – a function that returns all the products in storage in JSON format, each on a new line

The **constructor** should receive a **capacity**

Paste only the **Storage class in judge** ( **Note: all names should be as described** )

### Example

Test your Storage class

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| let productOne = {name: &#39;Cucamber&#39;, price: 1.50, quantity: 15}let productTwo = {name: &#39;Tomato&#39;, price: 0.90, quantity: 25}let productThree = {name: &#39;Bread&#39;, price: 1.10, quantity: 8}let storage = new Storage(50)storage.addProduct(productOne)storage.addProduct(productTwo)storage.addProduct(productThree)storage.getProducts()console.log(storage.capacity)console.log(storage.totalCost) | {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Cucamber&quot;,&quot;price&quot;:1.5,&quot;quantity&quot;:15}{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Tomato&quot;,&quot;price&quot;:0.9,&quot;quantity&quot;:25}{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Bread&quot;,&quot;price&quot;:1.1,&quot;quantity&quot;:8}253.8 |

# Objects and JSON

## 3. Movies

Write a function that stores information about movies. The info will be **name, director, date**. You can receive several types on input:

**&quot;add movie {movie name}&quot;** – add the movie

**&quot;{movie name} directed by {director}&quot;** – check if the movie exists and then add the director

**&quot;{movie name} on date {date}&quot;** – check if the movie exists and then add the date

At the end print all the movies that have **all the info** (if the movie has no author, name or data, don&#39;t print it) in **JSON format**

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| [&#39;add movie Fast and Furious&#39;,&#39;add movie Godfather&#39;,&#39;Inception directed by [Christopher Nolan](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0634240/?ref_=tt_ov_dr)&#39;,&#39;Godfather directed by [Francis Ford Coppola](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000338/?ref_=tt_ov_dr)&#39;,&#39;Godfather on date 29.07.2018&#39;,&#39;Fast and Furious on date 30.07.2018&#39;,&#39;Batman on date 01.08.2018&#39;,&#39;Fast and Furious directed by[Rob Cohen](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003418/?ref_=tt_ov_dr)&#39;] | {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Fast and Furious&quot;,&quot;director&quot;:&quot;Rob Cohen&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;30.07.2018&quot;}{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Godfather&quot;,&quot;director&quot;:&quot;Francis Ford Coppola&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;29.07.2018&quot;} |


## 4. Inventory

In the era of heroes, every hero has his own items which make him unique. Create a function which creates a **register for the heroes** , with their **names** , **level** , and **items** , if they have such. The register should accept data in a specified format, and return it presented in a specified format.

The **input** comes as **array of strings**. Each element holds data for a hero, in the following format:

&quot; **{heroName} / {heroLevel} / {item1}, {item2}, {item3}...**&quot;

You must store the data about every hero. The **name** is a **string** , the **level** is a **number** and the items are all **strings.**

The **output** is a **JSON representation** of the data for all the heroes you&#39;ve stored. The data must be an **array of all the heroes**. Check the examples for more info.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| [&quot;Isacc / 25 / Apple, GravityGun&quot;,&quot;Derek / 12 / BarrelVest, DestructionSword&quot;,&quot;Hes / 1 / Desolator, Sentinel, Antara&quot;] | [{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Isacc&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:25,&quot;items&quot;:[&quot;Apple&quot;,&quot;GravityGun&quot;]},{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Derek&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:12,&quot;items&quot;:[&quot;BarrelVest&quot;,&quot;DestructionSword&quot;]},{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Hes&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:1,&quot;items&quot;:[&quot;Desolator&quot;,&quot;Sentinel&quot;,&quot;Antara&quot;]}] |
