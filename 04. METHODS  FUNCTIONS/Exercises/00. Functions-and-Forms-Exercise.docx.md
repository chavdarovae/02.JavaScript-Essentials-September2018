# Functions

## 1. Smallest of Three Numbers

Write a JS function which receive **three integer** numbers to print the **smallest** of the three integer numbers. Use appropriate name for the function.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 2,5,3 | 2 |
| 600,342,123 | 123 |
| 25,21,4 | 4 |

## 2. Add and Subtract

You will receive 3 **integers.** Write a JSfunction **sum** to get the sum of the first two integers and **subtract** function that subtracts the third integer from the result from the Sum function.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 23,6,10 | 19 |
| 1,17,30 | -12 |
| 42,58,100 | 0 |

## 3. Characters in Range

Write a JSfunction that receives **two characters** and prints on a single line all the characters in between them according to the **ASCII** code.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| &#39;a&#39;,&#39;d&#39; | b c |
| &#39;#&#39;,&#39;:&#39; | $ % &amp; &#39; ( ) \* + , - . / 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 |
| &#39;C&#39;,&#39;#&#39; | $ % &amp; &#39; ( ) \* + , - . / 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 : ; \&lt; = \&gt; ? @ A B |

## 4. Odd and Even Sum

You will receive a **single number.**

You have to write a JS function, that returns the **sum** of **all even** and **all odds** digits from that number.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 1000435 | Odd sum = 9, Even sum = 4 |
| 3495892137259234 | Odd sum = 54, Even sum = 22 |

## 5. Palindrome Integers

A palindrome is a number which reads the same **backward as forward** , such as 323 or 1001. Write a JS function which receives an **array of positive integer** and checks if each integer is a palindrome or not.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
 | **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [123,323,421,121] | falsetruefalsetrue | | [32,2,232,1010] | falsetruetruefalse |

## 6. Password Validator

Write a JS function that checks if a given password is valid. Password rules are:

- **6 – 10 characters (inclusive)**
- **Consists only of letters and digits**
- **Have at least 2 digits**

If a password is valid print &quot;Password is valid&quot;. If it is not valid, for every unfulfilled rule print a message:

- **&quot;Password must be between 6 and 10 characters&quot;**
- **&quot;Password must consist only of letters and digits&quot;**
- **&quot;Password must have at least 2 digits&quot;**

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| &#39;logIn&#39; | Password must be between 6 and 10 charactersPassword must have at least 2 digits |
| &#39;MyPass123&#39; | Password is valid |
| &#39;Pa$s$s&#39; | Password must consist only of letters and digitsPassword must have at least 2 digits |

### Hints

Write a function for each rule.

## 7. Shortest and Longest word

You will receive a **single string.** This string will be a sentence. Your task here is to create JS function to find:

The **longest** and the **shortest** word in that sentence. If two words have **equal length** take the first occurrence.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| &#39;Hello people, are you familiar with the terms of application at the software university?&#39; | Longest -\&gt; application
 Shortest -\&gt; of |
| &#39;Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.&#39; | Longest -\&gt; typesetting
 Shortest -\&gt; is |

## 8. Perfect number

Write a JS function that receive a **number** and return if this number is perfect or not.

A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the **sum of its proper positive divisors**. That is the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its **aliquot sum** ).

Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is **half the sum** of all of its positive divisors (including itself) =\&gt; 6 is a perfect number, because it is the sum of 1 + 2 + 3 (all of which are divided without residue).

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 6 | We have a perfect number!1 + 2 + 3 |
| 28 | We have a perfect number!1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 |
| 1236498 | It&#39;s not so perfect. |

## 9. Loading bar

You will receive a **single number** between 0 and 100 which is divided with 10 without residue (0, 10, 20, 30...).

Your task is to create a JS function that visualize a **loading bar** depending on that number you have received in the input. See examples for more clarity.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 30 | 30% [%%%.......]Still loading... |
| 50 | 50% [%%%%%.....]Still loading... |
| 100 | 100% Complete![%%%%%%%%%%] |

## 10. Factorial Division

Write a JS Function that reaceives **two integ** er numbers. Calculate [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) of each number. Divide the first result by the second and print the division formatted to the **second decimal** point.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
 | **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 52
 | 60.00 |
 | 62 | 360.00 |
