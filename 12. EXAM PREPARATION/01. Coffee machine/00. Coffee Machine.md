# Coffee Machine

_Create a program for a coffee machine. Calculate whether the money inserted in the machine is enough to make the order and print the corresponding output._

### Input

The input is an **array of strings**. Each string represents one order with different parts, separated by comma and space **&#39;, &#39;**.

- The **first part** is the **coins inserted**.
- The **second** is the **type of drink** ( **coffee or tea** ).
- Next, if the drink type is **coffee** , you will receive **&#39;caffeine&#39;** or **&#39;decaf&#39;**.
- Next, you may receive **&#39;milk&#39;,** if the ordered drink is with milk. **It costs**** 10% of the drink price, rounded ****to first decimal point**
- And **last** you receive the **quantity of sugar, between 0 and 5**. **No matter the quantity (except from 0) it costs 0.10. Add the sugar at the end!**

The **prices of drinks** are:

| **Type** | **Price** |
| --- | --- |
| coffee caffeine | 0.80 |
| coffee decaf | 0.90 |
| tea | 0.80 |

### Constrains

- The input will always be **valid**

### Output

For each order there are **two possible** outputs:

- If the money inserted is enough, calculate the change of the order:

**&#39;You ordered {drink}. Price: {price}$ Change: {change}$&#39;**

- If the money is not enough:

**&#39;Not enough money for {drink}. Need {moneyNeeded}$ more&#39;**

After proceeding all orders, print the **total money earned** from the **successful** orders in the format: **&#39;Income Report: {totalMoney}$&#39;**

All of the numbers should be **formatted to the second decimal point**.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| [&#39;1.00, coffee, caffeine, milk, 4&#39;, &#39;0.40, tea, milk, 2&#39;,&#39;1.00, coffee, decaf, 0&#39;] | You ordered coffee. Price: 1.00$ Change: 0.00$Not enough money for tea. Need 0.60$ more.You ordered coffee. Price: 0.90$ Change: 0.10$Income Report: 1.90$ |
| **Comments** |
| The first order is coffee with caffeine, milk and sugar. The price of the drink is 0.80$, we calculate the milk, 10% of the price, rounded to the first decimal point - 0.1$, and we add the sugar =\&gt; 0.80 + 0.10 + 0.10 = 1.00.The second order is tea with milk and sugar (0.80 + 0.10 + 0.10 = 1.00), but the money inserted is not enough.Next, we receive order for coffee decaf with no milk and 0 sugar =\&gt; 0.90$. The change is 0.10$.Total income = 1.90 |
| **Input** | **Output** |
| [&#39;8.00, coffee, decaf, 4&#39;,&#39;1.00, tea, 2&#39;] | You ordered coffee. Price: 1.00$ Change: 7.00$You ordered tea. Price: 0.90$ Change: 0.10$Income Report: 1.90$ |
