Problems for exercises and homework for the [&quot;Technology Fundamentals&quot; course @ SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/trainings/2056/technology-fundamental-september-2018#lesson-9620).

You can check your solutions here: [Arrays-Exercise](https://judge.softuni.bg/Contests/1256/Arrays-Exercise)

## 1. Add or Subtract

Write a JS function, which changes the **value** of **odd** and **even** numbers in an **array of numbers**. If the number is **even**** add **to its value its** index **position. If the number is** odd ****subtract** to its value its index position. On the first line print the **newly modified array** , on the second line print the **sum** of numbers from the **original array** , on the third line print the sum of numbers from the **modified array**.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| [5, 15, 23, 56, 35] | [5, 14, 21, 59, 31]134130 |
| [-5, 11, 3, 0, 2] | [-5, 10, 1, 3, 6]1115 |

## 2. Common Elements

Write a JS function, which prints common elements in **two** arrays. Print all matches on **separate** lines. Compare the **first array** with the **second array**.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| [&quot;Hey&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, 2, 4, &quot;Pesho&quot;, &quot;e&quot;], [&quot;Pecho&quot;, 10, &quot;hey&quot;, 4, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;2&quot;] | hello4 |
| [&quot;S&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot; &quot;],[&quot;s&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;l&quot;] | o i |

## 3. Merge Arrays

Write a JS function which receives **two arrays** and **merges** them into a third array. If the **index** of the element is **even** , add into the third array the **sum** of **both elements** at that index. If the index of the element is **odd** , add the **concatenation** of both elements at that index.

As **input** you will receive **two string arrays**.

As **output** you should print the resulting **third** array, each element separated by **&quot; - &quot;**

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| [&quot;5&quot;, &quot;15&quot;, &quot;23&quot;, &quot;56&quot;, &quot;35&quot;],[&quot;17&quot;, &quot;22&quot;, &quot;87&quot;, &quot;36&quot;, &quot;11&quot;] | 22 - 1522 - 110 - 5636 - 46 |
| [&quot;13&quot;, &quot;12312&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;77&quot;, &quot;4&quot;],[&quot;22&quot;, &quot;333&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;122&quot;, &quot;44&quot;] | 35 - 12312333 - 10 - 77122 - 48 |

## 4. Array Rotation

Write a JS function that receives an **array** and **number of rotations** you have to perform (first element goes at the end) Print the resulting array.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| [51, 47, 32, 61, 21],2 | 32 61 21 51 47 |
| [32, 21, 61, 1],4 | 32 21 61 1 |
| [2, 4, 15, 31],5 | 4 15 31 2 |

## 5. Max Number

Write a JS function to find all the top integers in an array. A top integer is an integer which is **bigger** than all the elements to its right. Print **all** top integers on the console.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| [1, 4, 3, 2] | 4 3 2 |
| [14, 24, 3, 19, 15, 17] | 24 19 17 |
| [41, 41, 34, 20] | 41 34 20 |
| [27, 19, 42, 2, 13, 45, 48] | 48 |

## 6. Equal Sums

Write a JS function that determines if there **exists an element in the array** such that the **sum of the elements on its left** is **equal** to the **sum of the elements on its right**. If there are **no elements to the left / right** , their **sum is considered to be 0**. Print the **index** that satisfies the required condition or **&quot;no&quot;** if there is no such index.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** | **Comments** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [1, 2,3,3] | 2 | At a[2] -\&gt; left sum = 3, right sum = 3a[0] + a[1] = a[3] |
| [1, 2] | no | At a[0] -\&gt; left sum = 0, right sum = 2At a[1] -\&gt; left sum = 1, right sum = 0No such index exists |
| [1] | 0 | At a[0] -\&gt; left sum = 0, right sum = 0 |
| [1, 2, 3] | no | No such index exists |
| [10, 5, 5,99,3, 4, 2, 5, 1, 1, 4] | 3 | At a[3] -\&gt; left sum = 20, right sum = 20a[0] + a[1] + a[2] = a[4] + a[5] + a[6] + a[7] + a[8] + a[9] + a[10] |

## 7. Max Sequence of Equal Elements

Write a JS function that finds the **longest sequence of equal elements** in an array of numbers. If several longest sequences exist, print the leftmost one.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| [&#39;2 1 1 2 3 3 2 2 2 1&#39;] | 2 2 2 |
| [&#39;1 1 1 2 3 1 3 3&#39;] | 1 1 1 |
| [&#39;4 4 4 4&#39;] | 4 4 4 4 |
| [&#39;0 1 1 5 2 2 6 3 3&#39;] | 1 1 |

## 8. Magic Sum

Write a JS function, which prints all unique pairs in an array of integers whose sum is equal to a given number.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| [&#39;1 7 6 2 19 23&#39;, &#39;8&#39;] | 1 76 2 |
| [&#39;14 20 60 13 7 19 8&#39;, &#39;27&#39;] | 14 1320 719 8 |
| [&#39;1 2 3 4 5 6&#39;, &#39;6&#39;] | 1 52 4 |
