# Lab: Calculator using Javascript and ExpressJS

This document defines a complete walkthrough of creating a **Calculator** application with the [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) Framework, from setting up the framework, to implementing the models, views and controllers necessary for our application to function.

You can download the **calculator&#39;s skeleton** from [here](https://softuni.bg/downloads/svn/soft-tech/Sept-2018/JavaScript/09.Basic-Web/Exercise/05.%20JavaScript-ExpressJS-Overview-Exercise-Calculator-Skeleton.zip). The rest of the needed non-optional software is described in the guide above.

# Base Project Overview

Node.js is a **platform** written in **JavaScript** and provides **back-end** functionality. Express is a **module** (for now we can associate module as a **class** which provides some functionality), which wraps Node.js in way that makes coding faster and easier and it is suitable for the **MVC** architecture.

Initially the project comes with the following structure:

![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_f00a6b7228b80968.png)

We can see several folders here. Let look at them one by one and see what are they for:

1. **bin**  **–** Contains a single file named **www** , which is the **starting point** of our program. The file itself contains some **configuration** logic needed to run the server **locally**.
2. **node\_modules** (library root) – As far as the name tells us, in this folder we put every library ( **module** ) that our project depends on.
3. **public** – Everything in our **public** folder ( **files** , **images** , etc.) will be **accessible** by **every user**. We&#39;ll cover on that later.
4. **routes** –Afolder in which we will put our **route** configurations. We&#39;ll find out what a **route** is in a bit.
5. **views**  **–** There, we will store the views for our model. Again, we will use templates with the help of the **Handlebars** view engine.
6. **app.js** – The script containing the logic needed to **start the server**.
7. **package.json** – a file containing project information (like the project&#39;s **name** , **license** etc.). The most important thing is that there is a &quot; **dependencies**&quot; part, where all the names and versions of every module that our projects uses will reside.

Let&#39;s see what we have in the skeleton before we start working on it:

1.
## Open the Project

![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_789614d9e06780f7.png)

Let&#39;s go ahead and load the skeleton. Click &quot; **Open**&quot;, and find the downloaded and unzipped skeleton project:

![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_ac5f4494422bba3e.png)

![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_19ad09f0ad9ebdd1.png)

This is our Node.js project. In the previous steps, we described on how we got here. Now let&#39;s talk about **Node.JS** :

As we know, it&#39;s a **platform** written in **Javascript** , providing **back-end** functionality. This gives us a lot of flexibility, because our **front-end** usually uses **JavaScript** as well. This makes mutual **communication** easier.

Furthermore, Node.JS is fast because it uses C++ behind the scenes and also because it&#39;s capable of making asynchronous calls. It uses the [event loop system](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/nodejs_event_loop.htm).

Summary: we have downloaded the project and we are ready to start writing code!

1.
## Run the Project

Now that we&#39;ve opened the project, let&#39;s try running it, so we can see what we&#39;re working with. Go to the top right of WebStorm, where you&#39;ll find a Run button, which looks like a green play button:

![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_56a3ff4cdfa4bc18.png)

That&#39;s how we&#39;ll start our Express app. Go ahead and click the button. If everything goes according to plan, we should see this message on the console:

![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_60cfa3d1ef57119a.png)

Now we can open the page and see what we have:

![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_df3b8df1cdfc4f7b.png)
 It doesn&#39;t look like much, but at least we have the basic layout down! Let&#39;s get to work on implementing some functionality!

1.
# Implementing Functionality

1.
## Create Calculator View

Before we can have any functionality, it would be nice to have an idea of what we&#39;re working against, so let&#39;s go ahead and **create** a **form** , which the **user** will use for **calculations** :

Go into the **views/home** folder and open the **index.hbs** file:

![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_e24b2d6ae3adfd7f.png)

It&#39;s empty?! How does the header and footer seen above get displayed then? The answer is, we use a **global**** layout ****file** , so we don&#39;t have to copy-paste our page layout into every single view in our project (which could have **tens** or **hundreds** of views). All the **actual design HTML** is inside **layout.hbs**. We won&#39;t be touching that, so let&#39;s go to the **index.hbs** file and add our form:

| \&lt; **div**  **class=****&quot;container body-content span=8 offset=2&quot;**\&gt;
\&lt; **div**  **class=****&quot;well&quot;**\&gt;
\&lt; **form**  **class=****&quot;form-inline&quot; **** action= ****&quot;/&quot;**  **method=****&quot;POST&quot;**\&gt;
\&lt; **fieldset** \&gt;
\&lt; **div**  **class=****&quot;form-group&quot;**\&gt;
\&lt; **div**  **class=****&quot;col-sm-1 &quot;**\&gt;
\&lt; **input**  **type=****&quot;text&quot; **** class= ****&quot;form-control&quot;**  **id=****&quot;leftOperand&quot; **** placeholder= ****&quot;Left Operand&quot;**
**name=****&quot;calculator[leftOperand]&quot; **** value= ****&quot;** {{ **calculator**. **leftOperand** }} **&quot;** \&gt;
\&lt;/ **div** \&gt;
\&lt;/ **div** \&gt;

\&lt; **div**  **class=****&quot;form-group&quot;**\&gt;
\&lt; **div**  **class=****&quot; ****col-sm-4**  **&quot;** \&gt;
\&lt; **select**  **class=****&quot;form-control&quot; **** name=****&quot;calculator[operator]&quot;**\&gt;
\&lt; **option**  **value=****&quot;+&quot; **{{** selectif calculator **.** operator ****&#39;+&#39; **}}\&gt;+\&lt;/** option**\&gt;
\&lt; **option**  **value=****&quot;-&quot; **{{** selectif calculator **.** operator ****&#39;-&#39; **}}\&gt;-\&lt;/** option**\&gt;
\&lt; **option**  **value=****&quot;\*&quot; **{{** selectif calculator **.** operator ****&#39;\*&#39; **}}\&gt;\*\&lt;/** option**\&gt;
\&lt; **option**  **value=****&quot;/&quot; **{{** selectif calculator **.** operator ****&#39;/&#39; **}}\&gt;/\&lt;/** option**\&gt;
\&lt;/ **select** \&gt;
\&lt;/ **div** \&gt;
\&lt;/ **div** \&gt;

\&lt; **div**  **class=****&quot;form-group&quot;**\&gt;
\&lt; **div**  **class=****&quot; ****col-sm-4**  **&quot;** \&gt;
\&lt; **input**  **type=****&quot;text&quot; **** class= ****&quot;form-control&quot;**  **id=****&quot;rightOperand&quot; **** placeholder= ****&quot;Right Operand&quot;**
**name=****&quot;calculator[rightOperand]&quot; **** value= ****&quot;** {{ **calculator**. **rightOperand** }} **&quot;** \&gt;
\&lt;/ **div** \&gt;
\&lt;/ **div** \&gt;

\&lt; **div**  **class=****&quot;form-group&quot;**\&gt;
\&lt; **div**  **class=****&quot;col-sm-2 &quot;**\&gt;
\&lt; **p** \&gt;=\&lt;/ **p** \&gt;
\&lt;/ **div** \&gt;
\&lt;/ **div** \&gt;

\&lt; **div**  **class=****&quot;form-group&quot;**\&gt;
\&lt; **div**  **class=****&quot; ****col-sm-4**  **&quot;** \&gt;
\&lt; **input**  **type=****&quot;text&quot; **** class= ****&quot;form-control&quot;**  **id=****&quot;result&quot; **** placeholder= ****&quot;Result&quot;**
**name=****&quot;result&quot; **** value= ****&quot;** {{ **result** }} **&quot;** \&gt;
\&lt;/ **div** \&gt;
\&lt;/ **div** \&gt;

\&lt; **div**  **class=****&quot;form-group&quot;**\&gt;
\&lt; **div**  **class=****&quot; ****col-sm-4**  **col-sm-offset-4&quot;** \&gt;
\&lt; **button**  **type=****&quot;submit&quot; **** class= ****&quot;btn btn-primary&quot;** \&gt;Calculate\&lt;/ **button** \&gt;
\&lt;/ **div** \&gt;
\&lt;/ **div** \&gt;
\&lt;/ **fieldset** \&gt;
\&lt;/ **form** \&gt;
\&lt;/ **div** \&gt;
\&lt;/ **div** \&gt; |
| --- |

We will **save the state** of the operands and operator for ease of use, so the **handlebars syntax** you see here does just that. The **{{selectif}}** helper is a bit more special: it selects the operator from the dropdown list, **based on** the last used operator. We&#39;ll see how that&#39;s implemented a bit later. For now, let&#39;s navigate to our web app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) and see how we&#39;re doing:

![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_9b5a4d33c2753ab.png)

Looking good! Except it doesn&#39;t do anything. First, let&#39;s get down to making the thing, which will hold our data: the **model**.

1.
## Create Calculator Model

It&#39;s time to design our main model – the **Calculator**. It will contain the following properties:

- **leftOperand**
- **operator**
- **rightOperand**

Let&#39;s create our model in the **JavaScript** way. Since we&#39;re **not** using a database in this exercise, we&#39;re just going to define the calculator as a **simple JavaScript class**.

Create a folder, called &quot; **models**&quot; and inside it, create a **JavaScript** file, named &quot; **Calculator.js**&quot;:

![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_f9abfc9ee4d5f46c.png)

Now, let&#39;s write the code, which will define our **Calculator** model:

1. Create a function, which will be called upon creating a new calculator instance:
 ![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_4428b58f88cce823.png)

1. Inside it, **define** the calculator **properties** :

![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_8d575ae56c229b67.png)

1. Create a **function** for **calculating** the result from the **properties** :
 ![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_7bdd45561dce8e12.png)
 Inside this function, we&#39;ll write the logic, which is needed for calculating the result from the operands and operator. Let&#39;s create the logic, needed for that:
2. Write the calculation logic:
 ![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_2f0b96c91752a3c0.png)
3. Almost done: **export** our model so it can be **visible** for the **outer world** (outside of the **Calculator.js** file):
4. ![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_fbccb4aed54fd35d.png)

Summary: We now know how to create a simple model and make it visible to the outside world.

1.
## Add a Route, which Calls the Controller Action

As for the routing – with **ExpressJS** , all our routing logic is usually located within a file, called **routes.js**. Here&#39;s what that currently looks like:

![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_4d1e9891f82cb282.png)

Let&#39;s break this code down into understandable chunks:

- **const homeController = require(&#39;./../controllers/home&#39;)**

This bit of code **imports** our controller&#39;s logic. Before we can **call** any methods, we need to know those methods **exist** , right?

- **module.exports**

This is the piece of code which takes the code inside it and **exposes** it to the outside world. We&#39;re putting our code here, because Node.JS needs to have **access** to it, so it can **execute the action** when our user **calls** the specified **route** (examples: **/calculate** , **/edit/2** , **/login** ).

- **app.get(&#39;/&#39;, homeController.indexGet)**

This piece of code tells Node.JS to **listen** for any **GET requests** on the &quot; **/**&quot; route, and when it finds one – to execute the **homeController.indexGet** method (this is why we needed to **import** the **home controller** up there using **require()**.

Now that we&#39;ve understood how the **routing system** in **Express.JS** works, it&#39;s time to **add** our **own route** , which calls our own **controller**** action**, which gets the data from the user and uses it to calculate the result.

Since we&#39;re going to be sending out **form data** to the server, we&#39;re going to be using a **HTTP**** POST ****request** to do it. Hence, we need to tell **routes.js** to expect **POST requests** and **execute** the appropriate controller action:

![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_74e0c3ce38c9bfb3.png)

We just made a **route** , which listens on &quot; **/**&quot;, and upon matched, executes the **indexPost** action inside the **home controller**. That&#39;s alright, but the problem is we **don&#39;t have** an action with that name yet. So, guess what happens if we try to send a form to the server:

![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_1cef02e9450bc96f.png)

Not so great. For our final trick, we&#39;ll create our own controller action, which will **process** what the user sent us and **return** a **view** with the **result** from the calculation.

1.
## Implement the Controller Action

Now that we&#39;ve created the **view** , which will **hold our data** and allow the **user** to **interact** with our web application, it&#39;s time to create the driving force behind the whole app – **the controller**.

As it turns out, we already have a **home controller** set up, and an action, set up on the &quot; **/**&quot; route, otherwise we wouldn&#39;t even be able to see our calculator. You can find the **home controller** in the &quot; **controllers**&quot;folder. Let&#39;s see what it looks like:

![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_1ae93c81501139f3.png)

Not much going on here… Let&#39;s break it down:

- **module.exports**  the piece of code, which takes the code inside it and **exposes** it to the outside world. We&#39;re putting our code here, because the **router** needs to have **access** to it, so it can **execute the action** when our user **calls** the specified **route** (right now, that&#39;s &quot; **/**&quot;).
- **indexGet: (req, res)** This is the actual **controller action**. It&#39;s a function, which **holds the**** logic **, which will be** executed **, when it&#39;s** called **. It&#39;s** no different **than a** regular method**.
 It has 2 parameters: **req** and **res**. They hold data about the **HTTP**** request **and** HTTP ****response** respectively. They&#39;ll be used for **getting data** from the user and also doing things such as **rendering views** in the **response**. Remember – all we&#39;re doing here is returning different **HTML code** , based on the logic we&#39;ve implemented in our app.
- **res.render(&#39;home/index&#39;)** This function **renders** a **view** in the **response** (in essence, takes whatever&#39;s inside of &quot; **home/index.hbs**&quot;, runs it through the **Handlebars** templating engine, and returns it back to the user.

So, using this newfound knowledge, let&#39;s try to create our own **action**.

First, we&#39;ll start off by declaring the action:

![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_3dacc8fe86ab09f1.png)

As we know from above, we have **req** and **res** parameters. We&#39;ll use the **req** parameter to get the data from the **request**. That&#39;s the data the user **sent us** through the **form**. We can get a hold of that data by accessing **req.body** :

![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_3c838a7bd4e71790.png)

Before we continue, let&#39;s see what that property would hold if we looked at it during a **debug session** :

![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_d6d23d3bc5141bdb.png)

The data comes through the request as a **calculator** variable. Why does that happen? Well, let&#39;s look at what data we&#39;re sending the server with a tool like **Chrome Developer Tools**** (F12)**:

![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_711b9d1eaf69a049.png)

The form has a **calculator variable** with **3 values** , sent as **strings**. And as such, that comprises the **request body** – something we can access by using the **req.body** property. Let&#39;s go back into our controller action and **process** the data.

We can access the properties of the calculator by accessing the **request**** body **and getting the** calculator** as a key:

![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_8f0c6039333a177c.png)

Accessing **calculatoryBody**&#39;s values by the &quot; **calculator**&quot; key is the same as just writing &quot;**req.body[&#39;calculator&#39;]**&quot;, but we&#39;re extracting every step into variables for clarity.

Before we can use our **calculator model** , we need to tell the controller that it exists. We&#39;ll do that by **importing** it, using **require()** at the **top** of the file:

![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_51dbe69abfff8e23.png)

Next, we need to create an **instance** of our calculator model, which we&#39;ll use for storing the data inside:

![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_301c4a8ca6b151d.png)

We use the **Number()** function to convert the operands from **strings** to **numbers**. Now that we&#39;ve gotten the data, it&#39;s time to calculate the result from what we currently have. Remember that **calculateResult()** function we wrote a while ago? Now&#39;s the time to use it:

![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_5701d305cec6719c.png)

After that, all we have left is to **render**** the view **. We can do that by using the** render **function inside the** res** (response) method parameter:

![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_e2ec076e24dc8d7.png)

Let&#39;s break down what **res.render()** does:

- **&#39;home/index&#39;**
This parameter specifies which view to return.
- **{&#39;calculator&#39;: calculator, &#39;result&#39;: result}**
This parameter is a **JavaScript Object** , which specifies what we&#39;re going to **send** to **the view** (in our well-known **key**** -\&gt; ****value** pairs).
 So, when we send over the **calculator object** and the **result value** to the view, we can **fill** the **form fields** with our data. This happens here:
 ![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_74a474725b1c63fe.png)

We use the data from the controller in the **home/index.hbs** view to set the **values** of the form inputs to whatever we want. In this case, we set the **operands** , and select the last used **operator**.

1.
# Test the Application

All our hard work should finally pay off now, right? If you&#39;ve followed all the steps properly, and _ **read all the explanatory text** _, hopefully we should have a functioning calculator!

![](RackMultipart20200821-4-vn09cn_html_38595c4f178c3b8.png)

1.
# \* Implement Extra Functionality

Just like last time, you&#39;re free to implement extra functionality like **extra operators** , **input validation** , and whatever else you can think of. Happy coding. 

Next time we&#39;ll be using the same logic as the one in this lab to implement a **fully functioning blog system** , with a **database** behind it for storing everything and even **user authentication** and **security**. Have fun with JS! 
