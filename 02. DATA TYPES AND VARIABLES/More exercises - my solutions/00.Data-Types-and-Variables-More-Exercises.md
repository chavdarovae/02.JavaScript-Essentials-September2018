1. **Digits with Words**

Write a JS function that receives a **digit** in the form of a **word** and prints the **digit** as a **number**.

**Examples**

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| &#39;nine&#39; | 9 |
| &#39;two&#39; | 2 |
| &#39;zero&#39; | 0 |

**Hints**

- Use the **switch** case.

2. **Prime Number Checker**

Write a JS function to check if a number is prime (only wholly divisible by itself and one).

The **input** comes as a single number argument.

The **output** should be the return value of your function. Return **true** for prime number and **false** otherwise.

**Examples**

| **Input** | **Output** |
 | **Input** | **Output** |
 | **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7 | true |
 | 8 | false | 81 | false |

3. **Cone**

Write a JS function to calculate a cone&#39;s **volume** and **total**** surface area** by given height and radius at the base.

The **input** comes as two number arguments. The first element is the cone&#39;s **radius** and the second is its **height**.

The **output** should be printed to the console on a new line for every result. The result should be formatted to the **fourth decimal point**

**Examples**

| **Input** | **Output** |
 | **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3,5 | volume = 47.1239area = 83.2298 |
 | 3.3,7.8 | volume = 88.9511area = 122.0159 |

4. **Biggest of 3 Numbers**

Write a JS function that finds the **biggest of 3 numbers**.

The **input** comes as 3 parameters.

The **output** is the biggest from the input numbers.

**Examples**

| **Input** | **Output** |
 | **Input** | **Output** |
 | **Input** | **Output** |
 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| -2,7,3 | 7 |
 | 130,5,99 | 130 | 43,43.2,43.1 | 43.2 |



5. **Binary to Decimal**

Write a JS function that reads an 8-bit binary number and converts it to a decimal.

The **input** comes as one string element, representing a binary number.

The **output** should be printed to the console.

**Examples**

| **Input** | **Output** |
 | **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 00001001 | 9 |
 | 11110000 | 240 |

6. **Chess Board**

Write a JS function to print a chessboard of size **n X n**. See the example for more information.

The **input** comes as a single number argument **n**.

The **output** should be returned as a result of your function in the form of a string.

**Examples**

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | \&lt;div class=&quot;chessboard&quot;\&gt;\&lt;div\&gt;\&lt;span class=&quot;black&quot;\&gt;\&lt;/span\&gt;\&lt;span class=&quot;white&quot;\&gt;\&lt;/span\&gt;\&lt;span class=&quot;black&quot;\&gt;\&lt;/span\&gt;\&lt;/div\&gt;\&lt;div\&gt;\&lt;span class=&quot;white&quot;\&gt;\&lt;/span\&gt;\&lt;span class=&quot;black&quot;\&gt;\&lt;/span\&gt;\&lt;span class=&quot;white&quot;\&gt;\&lt;/span\&gt;\&lt;/div\&gt;\&lt;div\&gt;\&lt;span class=&quot;black&quot;\&gt;\&lt;/span\&gt;\&lt;span class=&quot;white&quot;\&gt;\&lt;/span\&gt;\&lt;span class=&quot;black&quot;\&gt;\&lt;/span\&gt;\&lt;/div\&gt;\&lt;/div\&gt; |

7. **Triangle Area**

Write a JS function that calculates a **triangle&#39;s area** by its 3 sides.

The **input** comes as three number arguments, representing one side of a triangle.

The **output** should be printed to the console.

**Examples**

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 2,3.5,4 | 3.4994419198 |

**Hints**

Use [Heron&#39;s formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula) to obtain the result.
